Loading device for application Rf_Device from file '4vsx35.nph' in environment D:\Xilinx\Xilinx\14.7\ISE_DS\ISE\.
   "adderN" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc4vsx35, package ff668, speed -10
This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for this device (1). Unless your design is
targeted at devices of this stepping level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any available performance and functional
enhancements for this device. The latest stepping level for this device is '2'. Additional information on "stepping
level" is available at support.xilinx.com.

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to 1.260 Volts)

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

Device speed data version:  "PRODUCTION 1.71 2013-10-13".
